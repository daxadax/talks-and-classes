--- # Notes for nutritional requirements
Nutritional requirements of mycelium (RMyc, pg 216-217)
  1. Macronutrients
    a. Carbon (C)
      i. the 'energy source' for living organisms
      ii. required for cellular energy and to build cellular structures
      iii. decomposer fungi obtain much of their carbon from digesting plant matter
    b. Nitrogen (N)
      i. the backbone of enzyme (chemical catalyst) production
      ii. the amount of available Nitrogen is a major limiting factor in cultivation
      iii. more nitrogen is often added in the form of manure or wheat bran
      iv. 1-2% of Nitrogen is about right for a substrate
      v. fruiting requires more nitrogen than the mycelium's vegetative state
    c. Oxygen (O)
      i. mushrooms use Oxygen in numerous cellular processes
  2. Micronutrients
    a. Phosphorus (K)
      i. used in the production of ATP, nucleic acids and cell membranes
    b. Sulfer (S)
      i. used to make amino acids
      ii. can provided in the form of vitamins B1 or B7
    c. Potassium (P)
      i. critical to fungal metabolism
      ii. influences the osmotic potential of hyphae (makes them more sneaky)
    d. Magnesium (Mg)
      i. influences the energy storage of ATP
    e. Calcium (Ca)
      i. regulate cell functions
      ii. transport sugars and proteins across cell walls
