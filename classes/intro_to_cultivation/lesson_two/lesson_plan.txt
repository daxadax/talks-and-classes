II. Working with Agar: The Basics
  A. What is Agar?
    1. Summary (RMyc, pg 229)
  B. Why use Agar? (RMyc, pg 229)
    1. Cleanup mushroom tissue
    2. Facilitate the responses of mycelium to various other entities
    3. Isolate and develop individual mycelium strains
  C. A quick note on strain isolation
    1. Cloning vs Strain Isolation
    2. Strain Selection Traits (RMyc, pg 234)
      a. recovery time from transfer
      b. quality of mycelium
      c. adaptability to substrates
      d. time from inoculation to fruiting
      e. duration between flushes
      f. temperature and cold shock requirements
      g. number of primordia that form/mature
      h. medicinal quality
      i. ability to degrade toxins
      j. antimicrobial activity/resistence
      k. appearance/flavor/texture
      l. shelf life
      m. etc
  C. Media Formulation
    1. components
      a. Carbon - dextrose, malt extract, potato water
      b. Proteins - cereal flour, peptone
      c. B Vitamins - yeast
      d. Minerals - gypsum
      e. A taste of what's to come - 3-5% to stiumulate digestive enzymes
    2. restricted ingrediants
      a. coconut, garlic, pomegranate, cinnamon, cloves, curry, cilantro
    3. the importance of a rotating menu
  D. Preparing and Sterilizing Agar
    1. pick a recipe
    2. heat slowly just to the point of incorporation
    3. be careful not to caramelize sugars - this is toxic to some fungi
    4. sterilize @15psi for 30 minutes
  E. Dealing with contamination (RMyc, pg 240)
    1. agar facilitates growth - that's the point
    3. contamination isn't a failure, it's part of the process
    4. more on this later...
  F. Spores or Tissue Cloning
    1. Assuming agar to start the process, the main choice is spores or tissue?
    2. Tissue - the preferred choice
      a. known traits/ avoids randomizing effect of spores (non-fruting strains)
      b. Found/foraged fruit bodies from an unusual substrate (toxic, novel, ..)
      c. Preserving a given strain's genetics
      d. faster
    3. Spores - mycelial roulette
      a. sometimes you want to play roulette - experimental strains for remediation
      b. spores are the only availabe inoculum
      c. apathy - you can't be asked to select for certain traits
      d. the strain you've worked with is losing steam; it's time to start fresh
III. Contamination
  A. The 8 Causes of Contamination (RMyc, pgs 208-209)
    1. The Cultivator
    2. The Air
    3. The Environment
    4. The Substrate
    5. The Inoculum
    6. The Tools
    7. Pests
    8. Technique (the disciple of do easy)
  B. On the cultivator's role
    1. Learn to identify competitors
    2. Isolate contaminated projects
    3. Dispose of contaminated projects properly
    4. Don't try to fight, it only makes it worse
  C. Keep your friends close...
    1. Healthy mycelium
      a. where and when to look for it
        i. all the time, hopefully
      b. [IMAGES] identification (mycelium_1-3)
      c. Know your target myc! (Laetiporus sulphureus image)
  D. ...and your enemies closer
    1. Mold and other Fungi
      a. where and when to look for it
        i. agar (especially Penicilium and Aspergillius spp)
        ii. grain jars
        iii. during fruiting
        iv. all stages - mold is everywhere, stay attentive!
      b. wispy, radial, changes from white to another color
      c. [IMAGES] (aspergillius_*)
    2. Bacteria & Yeast
      a. where and when to look for it
        i. agar
        ii. grain jars (wet spots)
        iii. fruiting (wet spots, discolorations)
      b. form individual colonies
      c. [IMAGES] identification (Brett, Bacillius)
    3. Viruses
      a. where and when to look for it
      b. you can only see the results on fruits
      c. not very common
  E. How to deal
    1. Rescue attempts
      a. Transfer myc to a new plate
      b. Cover the whole thing with hot agar
      c. Wait it out
    2. Make a few 'blanks' to identify weak spots in your process
    3. Be a Contamophobe (EGCM, pg 48)
IV. Sanitation
  A. 'Work Smarter, Not Harder'
    1. Sanitation is hard
    2. Find every trick you can to make it unnecessary
      a. Agar jars, for example
      b. minimize non-sterile contact
      c. develop stronger strains
  B. "Preparing the Landing Zone" - Sanitation
    1. Cleaning, Habit and Ritual - EGCM, pg 44
    2. The cultivator is best when s/he is simply a facilitator
      a. The mycelium knows what to do
      b. Setup the environment as best you can with minimal interference
V. Yin and Yang/Contamination and Sanitation
    1. Don't be too accepting, don't get too aggressive
    2. Strive to find a balance
    3. Stop there - it's possible and easy to go too far
VI. Unknown Unknowns - What we're not covering
  A. Liquid Cultures - more mushrooms faster
    1. Why didn't we cover this?
      a. agar is more versitile
      b. some techniques (like cultivating spores) are only available via agar
      c. easier to see the results
      d. possible to clean
      e. better to learn the 'hard' way first
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself (RMyc, pg 241-242)
      a. cheap
      b. fast and efficient - one good LC can last many months
      c. no agar!
      d. increases myceliation AND innoculation rates (3D vs 2D expansion)
      e. reduces or eliminates the need for a still-air transfer space
  B. Agar Plates - more contact vs. more room to experiment
    1. Why didn't we cover this?
      a. more expensive
      b. more work and higher contamination rates (leading to even more work)
      c. more required equipment (still-air transfer space)
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
      a. plates can be really great to use when you get the process
      b. easier to isolate strains
      c. street cred
  C. Gloveboxes - minimize contact
    1. Why didn't we cover this? 
      a. we're not using plates
      b. the agar jars approximate a sterile environment
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
      b. many teks require a still-air transfer space
  D. Incubators
    1. Why didn't we cover this?
      a. not enough time
      b. easy to DIY, many plans available online
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
      a. Speed up!
      b. Lower rates of contamination
