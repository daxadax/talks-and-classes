    4. Dealing with contamination (RMyc, pg 240)
      a. it grows everything - that's the point
      b. Transfer myc to a new plate
      c. Cover the whole thing with hot agar
      d. Wait it out

  C. Nutritional requirements of mycelium (RMyc, pg 216)
    1. ???
  D. A Deeper Look at Phase One
    1. Starting point
      a. when there is tissue to clone or spores to germinate
    2. “The first step toward growing fruit bodies is to obtain a healthy and
    competitor-free culture of mycelium” (RMyc, pg 228)
    3. "Expanding the mass...is the primary goal" (EGCM, pg 18)
    4. Options
      b. spores, live mycelium, dry mushrooms
      c. agar, liquid inoculum, cardboard
IV. Contamination
  A. Keep your friends close...
    1. Healthy mycelium
      a. where and when to look for it
      b. [IMAGES] identification
  B. ...and your enemies closer
    1. On the cultivator's role
      a. Learn to identify competitors
      b. Isolate contaminated projects
      c. Dispose of contaminated projects properly
      d. Don't try to fight, it only makes it worse
    2. Mold and other Fungi
      a. where and when to look for it
      b. [IMAGES] identification
    3. Bacteria
      a. where and when to look for it
      b. [IMAGES] identification
    4. Viruses
      a. where and when to look for it
      b. how to recognize it
  B. The 8 Causes of Contamination (RMyc, pgs 208-209)
    1. The Cultivator
    2. The Air
    3. The Environment
    4. The Substrate
    5. The Inoculum
    6. The Tools
    7. Pests
    8. Technique (the disciple of do easy)
  C. Be a Contamophobe (EGCM, pg 48)
III. Sanitation
  A. 'Work Smarter, Not Harder'
    1. Sanitation is hard
    2. Find every trick you can to make it unnecessary
      a. Agar jars, for example
      b. minimize non-sterile contact
      c. develop stronger strains
  B. "Preparing the Landing Zone" - Sanitation
    1. Cleaning, Habit and Ritual - EGCM, pg 44
    2. The cultivator is best when s/he is simply a facilitator
      a. The mycelium knows what to do
      b. Setup the environment as best you can with minimal interference
  C. Yin and Yang
    1. Do what you must to find balance
    2. Stop there - it's possible and easy to go too far
V. Unknown Unknowns - What we're not covering
  A. The little known poetry of Donald Rumsfeld
  B. Gloveboxes - minimize contact
    1. Why didn't we cover this? 
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
  C. Liquid Cultures - more mushrooms faster
    1. Why didn't we cover this?
      a. agar is more versitile
      b. easier to see the results
      c. possible to clean
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
  D. Agar Plates - more contact vs. more room to experiment
    1. Why didn't we cover this?
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
  E. Incubators - faster, stronger mycelium
    1. Why didn't we cover this?
    2. Why you might want to research it yourself
