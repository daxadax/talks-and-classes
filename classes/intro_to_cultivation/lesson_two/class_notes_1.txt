First time teaching this class

could be better
* computer/presentation took a long time to set up
* more clear instruction regarding agar
* photo of a glovebox would be helpful
* check the needle size first as related to agar levels
* made too much agar

was good
* pacing
* content and flow/transitions
* students did the review of the previous lesson
