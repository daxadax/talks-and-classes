Lesson Three

Required equipment:

  * Sterilized agar jars, syringes, water jars
  * Enough hydrated popcorn for (students*3) 900ml jars
  * Mushrooms to clone + backup clean mycelium samples

Required preperation:

  * PC agar jars from last week
  * PC syringes, needles and several water jars
  * Soak/Prepare popcorn

Goals for this this lesson:

  * Review last week's main points
  * Cloning mushroom tissue using filter jars in theory
  * Spawn options and preparations
  * Unknown Unknowns - cardboard spawn
  * Cloning mushroom tissue using filter jars in theory
  * Loading jars with prepared popcorn / paper

I. Introduction
  A. Goals for this lesson
  B. Review
    1. Why use Agar?
      a. cleanup mushroom tissue
      b. train mycelium to digest new chemicals
      c. isolate and develop strains
    2. Difference between cloning and strain isolation?
    3. What are the main components of nutritious agar?
      a. carbon, proteins, b vitamins, minerals, 6-10% of what's to come
    4. The most likely cause of contamination is the cultivator
    5. What does [mycelium, mold, bacteria] look like?
    6. What is the difference between Pastuerization and Sterilization?
II. Cloning mushroom tissue using filter jars in theory
  A. Necessary materials and equipment
    1. 1 agar jar
    2. 1 filter jar 3/4 full of water
    3. 1 fresh mushroom (the fresher the better)
    4. 1 syringe/luer-lock needle
    5. 70% alcohol and paper towel
    6. aluminium foil
    7. labels and a pen
    8. optionally, 3% h202
  B. Process
    1. Sterilize equipment
      a. wrap the syringe and needle in foil, cover the jar lids with foil
      b. PC at 15psi for 15-20 minutes and allow to cool
    2. Draw up some sterile water
      a. unwrap the sterile water jar and syringe
      b. gently wipe the silicone injection port with alcohol
      c. upcap the needle and wipe with alcohol
      d. quickly insert the needle and draw up 3-5mL of sterile water
    3. Preform tissue biopsy - this should be preformed smoothly and quickly
      a. wipe the mushroom stem or cap with alcohol
      b. wipe the needle with alcohol and quickly insert it into the tissue
      c. remove the needle and quickly check to see if tissue is present
      d. optionally, dip the needle into a jar of h202 for 5-10 seconds
      e. wipe the silicone port of the agar jar with alcohol
      f. insert the needle and gently press until the tissue is ejected
      g. label and date the jar and incubate/store
      h. repeat, using multiple jars/tissue samples to ensure a clean sample

* grain spawn overview: RMyc pp 247-252
* preparing and incoculating grain: EGCM pp 107 - 115
* preparing various spawn mediums: EGCM pp 116-125
* what is spawn and why use it? MCIV p 32
* practical aspects of spawn production: MCIV 105-129
* cardboard spawn: RMyc p 239, MycRunning p 137/ 142-147
