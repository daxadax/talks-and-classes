First time teaching this class

could be better
* Goals could be communicated more clearly/succinctly
* Things should be simpler and more aimed at absolute beginners.
* Mushroom life cycle can be more streamlined
* Reading things from the book is not so comfortable
  * Write it out on a slide
  * Split it up on multiple slides
  * Give to students as handouts
* Break down decomposer vs mychorrhizal better
  * mychorrhizal means relationship with plants
* Phases of Cultivation (V.B) was a bit too long
  * more direct
  * more pictures
* Make sure we get 100% pure silicone
* Make sure we get squeeze tube silicone

was good
* mention enoki in III.C.2 and then mention again in III.E.5.b
* introductions went very well, group is nice. 
* 5W's were clear
* pacing was quite okay
  * the introductions took a lot of time
  * the phases of cultivation got squeezed a bit to compensate
