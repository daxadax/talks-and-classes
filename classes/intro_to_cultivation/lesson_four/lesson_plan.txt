Lesson Four:

Required equipment:

  * Sterilized spawn jars, syringes and water jars
  * Colonized agar jars

Required preperation:

  * PC spawn jars, syringes, needles and water jars

Goals for this this lesson:

  * Review last week's main points
  * Discuss substrate function and options by species
  * Bare metal requirements for fruiting by species
  * List of resources and recommended reading
  * Final review of relevant course material
  * Questions about the course and what comes next
  * Transfer mycelium to spawn jars

I. Introduction
  A. Goals for this lesson
  B. Review
    1. Cloning Tissue - walkthrough of the steps
      a. Sterilize equipment
      b. Draw up sterile water
      c. Perform tissue biopsy
    2. What were the biggest challenges of tissue cloning?
    3. Why use grain spawn?
    4. 4 most common grains to use for spawn
      a. rye, millet, bird seed, popcorn
    5. Hydration - what is it and why is it necessary?
      a. softens the grain so the mycelium can penetrate
      b. provides water to the mycelium
      c. wakes up endospores so they can be killed
