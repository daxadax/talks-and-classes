I. Introduction
  A. Goals for this lesson
  B. Review
    1. Cloning Tissue - walkthrough of the steps
      a. Sterilize equipment
      b. Draw up sterile water
      c. Perform tissue biopsy
    2. What were the biggest challenges of tissue cloning?
    3. Why use grain spawn?
    4. 4 most common grains to use for spawn
      a. rye, millet, bird seed, popcorn
    5. Hydration - what is it and why is it necessary?
      a. softens the grain so the mycelium can penetrate
      b. provides water to the mycelium
      c. wakes up endospores so they can be killed
II. All about Substrate
  A. What is Substrate? (MC IV, pg 19)
    1. The material on which mycelium grows
    2. A substrates properties determine which fungi and microbes can grow in it
    3. The environment also plays a role
      a. Relative humidity
      b. Ventilation / FAE
      c. Light levels
      d. temperature
  B. Substrate Selectivity (MC IV, pp 19-22)
    1. The better the substrate meets the demands of a specific species and the
    less suitable it is for other species, the more *selective* it is.
    2. Some fungi can use a broad range of substrate (Oysters)
    3. Some fungi can use only certain narrowly defined materials (Shiitake)
    4. Selectivity depends on:
      a. species - all of these parameters are dependent on species
      b. available nutrients
        i. the more accessible nutrients are available, the higher the yield
        ii. the more accessible nutrients are available, the higher the risk of
        contamination
      c. compactness
        i. too loose and the mycelium requires a lot of energy to expand
        ii. too tight and the mycelium can't breath
      d. water content and activity
        i. too much water clogs air flow
        ii. too little water provides...too little water
        iii. the squeeze test - like an old man peeing
          - you should get a few drops from normal pressure
      e. pH level
        i. Neutral is 7, lower is acidic, higher is basic
        ii. most cultivated mushrooms prefer a slightly acidic environment
        iii. low pH can also be an indication of bacterial infection
        iv. chalk and gypsum are the most common ways to stabilize pH
      g. environment - humidity, fresh air, light & temperature
III. Requirements by Species
  A. I prefer the Shroomery for this: "<Species genus> shroomery"
  B. Most species benefit from a cold shock to begin fruiting
  C. Flammulina velutipes (Enoki)
    i. spawn run 22-26
    ii. fruiting 3-15
    iii. sterilized hardwood/paper
  D. Hericium erinaceus (Lion's Mane)
    i. spawn run 25
    ii. fruiting 15-25/20-28 (depends on strain)
    iii. sterilized supplemented sawdust
  E. Hypsizygus tessulatus (Shimeji)
    i. spawn run 21-24
    ii. fruiting 13-18
    iii. sterilized suplimented sawdust
  F. Lentinula edodes (Shiitake)
    i. spawn run 20-30
    ii. fruiting 8-24 (depends on strain)
    iii. sterilized supplemented sawdust + wood chips (depends on strain)
  G. Pleurotus eryngii (King Oyster)
    i. spawn run 20-25
    ii. fruiting 15-22
    iii. hardwood sawdust and/or supplemented wheat straw
  G. Pleurotus ostreatus (Oyster)
    i. spawn run 20-25
    ii. fruiting 5-25
    iii. like, everything. straw, paper, coffee, sawdust, wood chips, soybean
    waste, agave waste, palm-oil by-products, etc
  I. Psilocybe cubensis (the 'magic' mushroom)
    i. spawn run 27-30
    ii. fruiting 22-24
    iii. pastuerized cow or horse manure, coconut coir, straw, etc
IV. Fruiting
  A. Caveat
    i. this is very, very basic - research online!
  B. Materials
    i. clean plastic bags
    ii. pasteurized substrate (coffee, straw, etc - depends on the species)
    iii. clean spawn
    iv. rubberband
    v. a large bowl or container for mixing
    vi. rubbing alcohol (70%)
    vii. optionally, polyfil and toilet paper tube
  C. Process
    i. wash your hands and wipe them with alcohol
    ii. wash the bowl and wipe it with alcohol
    iii. combine the substrate and spawn and mix together (consider ratio)
    iv. load into bags with a toilet paper tube at the top
    v. wrap a rubberband around the toilet paper tube and stuff with polyfil
    vi. when the bag is fully colonized, make some openings (top or sides)
    vii. consider building a shotgun fruiting chamber - humidity and fae
V. PF Tek
  A. Why use this tek?
    i. Fast, easy and nearly fool-proof
    ii. Good for getting the feel of the cultivation cycle as a beginner
    iii. Great for making small batches and/or for experimentation
  B. The Technique
    i. see the resources section for the full tutorial
    ii. prepare the substrate (vermiculite, brown rice flour and water)
    iii. fill small, straight-walled jars with the substrate and PC
    iv. innoculate the substrate with mycelium or a spore syringe
    v. after full colonization, 'birth' the jars into a fruiting chamber
    vi. mist and fan as necessary and wait for fruits
