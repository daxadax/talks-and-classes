Lesson One

Goals for this lesson: 

  * Basic understanding of mushroom lifecycle
  * Primary/Secondary decomposers vs Mychorrhizal Fungi
  * Define our focus: home-scale cultivation
  * 5 W's regarding home cultivation
  * Basic understanding of fungal needs and the cultivator's role
  * Safe PC usage
  * Basic understanding of filter jars and why we'll use them

I. Introduction
  A. Who am i?
  B. Who are you?
II. Mushroom Life Cycle
  A. [IMAGE] fungi life cycle - Russel, pg 18
  B. [IMAGE] fungi life cycle - McCoy, pg 10
  C. Decomposers
  D. Mychorrhizal
III. 5W's of Home Cultivation
  A. Who can cultivate mushrooms at home?
    1. Anyone! 
    2. Invest various amounts of time, money and interest
  B. What is the goal here?  What can I learn?
    1. Home-scale cultivation (but that's still broad!)
    2. How to clone a mushroom (any mushroom - forest or market)
    3. Build up mycelium in a controlled environment
    4. Resources about where to learn more
  C. When can mushrooms be cultivated?
    1. Anytime!
    2. Seasonal changes can be used to focus on different species
  D. Where can mushrooms be cultivated?
    1. (almost) Anywhere!
      a. apartment
      b. office
      c. storage locker
      d. somewhere you will be often
      e. somewhere you can automate
      f. somewhere with basic facilities and stable temperature
  E. Why cultivate mushrooms?
    1. Food
      a. excellent source of protein for vegans (and everyone)
      b. food security - produce food locally
      c. circular economy - produce food from local waste streams
      d. permaculture - mushrooms are extremely multi-functional
    2. Medicine
      a. EXAMPLES
      b. EXAMPLES
      c. EXAMPLES
    3. Psychedelics
      a. probably a few here for this anyway...
      b. this is how home-scale cultivation got started
      c. the best horticulturists grow pot, the best mycologists...
    4. Research
      a. natural systems
      b. mycointernet!
    5. Remediation
      a. oil spills - EXAMPLES
      b. weapons caches - EXAMPLES
      c. OTHER STUFF
    6. Education and projects for kids
    7. Businesses and community projects
V. Fungal Needs and the Cultivator's Role
  A. "The 5 Fungal Needs" (Radical Mycology, pg 203)
    1.
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.
  B. Phases of Cultivation
    1. Russel, pg 18
    2. Radical Mycology, "Phases of Cultivation"
  C. "Preparing the Landing Zone" - Sanitation
    1. Russel, pg 44
    2. The cultivator is best when s/he is simply a facilitator
      a. The mycelium knows what to do
      b. Setup the environment as best you can with minimal interference
