PF TEK via Spore Prints

Required equipment:

  * 250ml wide-mouth canning jars (4 per participant)
  * Hammer(s) & Nail(s)
  * Sterilized syringe/needle (2-3x per participant)
  * Sterilized water in 50ml airport jar (ideally 1 per participant)

Required materials:

  * Spore prints
  * Aluminium foil
  * Vermiculite (~1500ml per participant)
  * BRF / nutrient (~600ml per participant)
  * Polyfil
  * Micropore tape
  * 70% Isopropyl alcohol

Required preparation:

  * Prep 2 jars/participant (fill with verm/nutrient and sterilize)
  * Sterilize all required syringes and water jars

Goals for this lesson:

  * Get to know each other!
  * The basic history of home cultivation and where the PF-TEK fits
  * Learn the mushroom lifecycle
  * Simple sanitary procedures and why they are important
  * How to make spore syringes
  * PF-TEK substrate
  * Innoculation
  * What comes next
