PF TEK via Tissue Cloning

Description:
The PF Tek was pioneered by Robert McPherson (aka Psylocybe Fanaticus) in the
early 90s as a reliable technique for home mushroom cultivation. This workshop
introduces students to an updated version of the original PF Tek with greater
focus on simplicity and sustainability.

In this workshop we will work with Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), a
popular, easy to grow species which is nutritious, delicious, highly medicinal
and used increasingly for mycoremediation and sustainable material projects.

The workshop encompasses theory, demo and practice as well as a handout
outlining all procedures for your reference when continuing your studies at
home.

All required equipment and materials are supplied as part of the course fee.
