The true mysteries of this world do not require your connivance or belief in
order to exist. They're able to exist quite independently, thank you, whether
you belive in them or not. 

On the other hand, all forms of fraud and duplicity require the cooperation of
the mark.  That's you, if you're buying into these things.

...the idea is not to confront bad ideas but to come up with good ideas.
Otherwise, your enemies define the game and you are the loyal opposition.  How
many years have we been the loyal opposition and hasn’t it been an unsatisfying
experience?  So I think every single one of us has immense inner resources and
the psychedelics confirm that.  By inner resources - of intelligence and
information and beauty.  

I think we would be happier people and this would be a better world if we spent
more time bringing that out rather than opposing somebody else’s vision of what
is happening.  The I-Ching says at one point, “if evil is directly confronted
and named, it perfects weapons to defend itself.”  It says, in any direct
confrontation with evil, you show it, you reflect too much of it back upon
itself and it learns to defend itself. - Terence McKenna (the primacy of direct
experience)

Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? Have
you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you
not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? You
wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. Let the light of your
madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised
and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life...If you want to find
paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of
your nature

We're not asking everybody to feel that they must take drugs, but rather, just
as a woman should be free to control her body, for heaven's sake, a person
should also be free to control his or her mind. Everyone should be free to do it
and be well informed of the option. Drug information isn't that much different
from sex information.

The basis of my talk can be summed up by these three thoughts:  

“I really think that the major political obligation upon all of us is to get 
more stoned. Take larger hits.” - Terence McKenna

"...one of the responsibilities of being granted the visions is to make the 
visions then as real as you can." - Kat Harrison

"Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for the grave, to 
which you are bound, knows neither working, nor planning, nor knowledge, nor 
wisdom" - Ecclesiates 9:10

---

I want to explore how psychedelics can act as a catalyst to create and sustain 
conscious, authentic interaction with ourself, our perception of the other, and 
the sum total of the situations we find ourselves in.  If this is the 
'skeleton', the flesh would be provided via ideas such as narrative psychology, 
alchemy, Jungian individuation and subjective idealism.  

Ouspensky's aim and Jodorowsky's starfish as related to Kat Harrison's thought.  

Prevailing wisdom would suggest that opposition is essential to change.  Put in
Hegelian terms, a thesis meets its antithesis in order to create a synthesis.
Tit for tat.  Action is met with reaction. For example, the government or big
business or whomever does something you dislike, so you protest.  They throw a
punch, so you throw a punch.  Back and forth.  Eventually, this way of thinking
tries to convince us, the tides will change.  Eventually my punch will be the
knockout punch, and those aggressive forces that pushed me to react will meet
their doom.  (“And the meek shall inherit the earth.”)

This is, unfortunately, a fantasy.  Action will always prevail.  Reaction will
always fail. (Did protest end the war in Vietnam?  Did protest stop the war in
Iraq?  Did protest stop the destruction of collective bargaining in Wisconsin
recently?  — No.  It did not.  Why?  Because protest is reactive, not active;
it is negative rather than affirmative; it assumes the subordinate position “I
am against X!” rather than the dominate position “I am for X!”)  It is the myth
Nietzsche exposes in his groundbreaking and devastating Genealogy of Morals, a
book that is central to my understanding of Deleuze’s ethical applicability.
For Nietzsche, Deleuze, and myself, direct engagement is a mistake.  Diffuse or
indirect engagement is preferable.  Diagonal rather than horizontal or vertical
attack.  Non-Euclidean game plans. Rhizome rather than root, molecular rather
than molar, dynamic rather than static: reroute the flow of power toward new
creative constructions.  Think of it like a tug of war: the opposition relies
on your engagement, on your antithesis.  Without it, they would fall on their
butts in the same way a person would fall on their butt if you were playing tug
of war and suddenly let go of your end of the rope.  By engaging with the
opposition you merely serve to validate and empower that opposition.  The only
form of power one can truly wield is the power of action, of affirmation, of
creation.  Let go of the rope!  You’re tired of going to the grocery store and
finding fruits and vegetables from overseas, which have been treated with
cancer-causing chemicals?  Don’t bother fussing with the management or writing
a letter to your congressman…let go of the rope and go build an organic
community garden. Action.  Creation.  Do not be duped into thinking that you
can win a battle against the powers that be – they are the powers that be
because they took action, because they created something.
(http://htmlgiant.com/random/the-beginners-guide-to-deleuze/)

“We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even 
listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you 
are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, and if you're worrying 
about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are 
disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, icons which are maintained by 
an electronic media so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This 
is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what 
is real is you and your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, 
your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, 
we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And then 
you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want to reclaim 
your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn 
you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured 
out of the bones of a dying world.” - Terence McKenna 

```
Part of what is wrong with our society, and hence, with ourselves, is that we
consume images. We don’t produce them. We need to produce and not consume media.
Media is a huge issue. You can’t escape it, so what are you going to do about
it? The only solution is to drive it, to take charge, or otherwise you will be
poisoned by it. As more and more people are waking up to this – essentially we
are seeing I think, a huge artistic revolution. A revolution in values that
reaches into science, into politics, and into every aspect of life, but that is
coming from the imagination thoroughly stimulated and activated by the discovery
of all these natural and synthetic substances that perturb the mind. I’m also
not denying that a certain amount of social chaos goes along with this. On the
other hand, I can point to pretty psychedelically pure centuries, like the 13th
in Europe, and there was still plenty of social chaos going on. I don’t think
that you can lay social chaos at the feet of psychedelics. I think that social
chaos is an inimical part of the system. What psychedelics do is give a
direction to that chaos. They give a dimension of vertical ascent, because
inevitably, out of the psychedelic situation emerges, not despair, not
self-indulgence, but wild-eyed idealism. That’s the inevitable product of any
psychedelically driven social process. How well that idealistic idea then
brokers its way to the throne, if it does, is another issue.

So then the question becomes for some: “but I have nothing to say, or I have
nothing to paint, or I have nothing to communicate.” Clearly your not taking
enough drugs then – those excuses simply will not be tolerated. If someone finds
that decadent, flippant or destructive - then they don’t understand what these
psychedelic substances are. They open the doorway to creativity. They cleanse
the doors of perception, then as Blake said, “reality is perceived as it truly
is, as infinite.”
```

Other forms of science may deal with the states of the quanta or the orbits of
the Pleiades, but shamanism is the science of direct experience and its
laboratory is the human body and the human nexus in space and time.  You’re
given on average, sixty or seventy years, and on average, a hundred and
forty-five pounds of meat.  This is what you’re dealt, the meat and the time.
Then it’s up to you to sort this out and make of it what you will.  The
entropic path, the downward path into blame, unhappiness, self-blocking, so
forth and so on - that’s always there.  You can release yourself into the river
of consequences and take no responsibility for who you are but the higher
stakes game, the more interesting game, is to see the whole thing as an
opportunity.  - Terence McKenna (the primacy of direct experience)

Nietzche's "Whatever we have words for..." as compared to Wittgenstein's
"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" - and the implication is
that one of the primary roles of the psychonaut is to invent language.

Heidegger - I’m amazed that I’m quoting Heidegger so much this morning -
Heidegger again, he said the body is not a thing, nor is it a process, which is
surprising because that’s considered an advanced view, that it is a process.  He
said it is not a thing, nor is it a process, it is a window of opportunity which
opens into eternity.  It’s a window of opportunity.  But opportunity implies the
non exercise of itself.  An opportunity is something that you must seize.  It
doesn’t press itself upon you.  It doesn’t force itself upon you.  It merely is
there if you want to use it.

``` the winter king
What does all this mean for us beyond the commitment to our own sort of ordering
the wunderkammer of our own private imagination? What it means is important
because if you look around you, you will see the entire global civilization is
undergoing some kind of meltdown. The planet itself is now to be seen as a kind
of alchemical retort. The prima materia to be transformed are: the nuclear
stockpiles, the toxic waste dumps, the industrial wastelands, the populations
devoid of hope, and the populations at threat of fatal and epidemic disease.
There is a great deal of prima materia to be worked on at the historical level
of the alchemical process. Trying to manage this rationally with some political
‘ism’; fascism, Marxism, capitalism, goes nowhere. It just digs us deeper into
the mire and the muck.

At the fringes, people like you, people like myself, people I associate with,
offer endless solutions. We offer recycling, restraint in child bearing, and
increased sexual toleration of unusual sexual styles. Many, many things are
suggested but nothing happens because the primary agenda of society has not yet
been dissolved. It has not yet come into a state of fluidity sufficient where a
new imprint can be put upon in.

In the 1960s, we thought that all that had to happen was - everybody would take
LSD and the obvious right things to do would be done. We expected no opposition
to this because it’s rightness was so obvious. We didn’t realize that every
righteous crusade in history has marched into the waiting jaws of its
oppressors. But the spirit doesn’t die. It’s interesting but in America, we
refer to, and have always referred to freaks as Bohemians. I assumed, you always
hear about the left bank Bohemia of Paris in the 1920s - but why Bohemia? What
does Bohemia have to do with Paris? Why are freaks called Bohemians? It’s
because of Frederick the Elector and the alchemical renaissance that he plotted
with his wife. Since that time to now, ‘Bohemian’ has meant a marginal political
position involved with bizarre sexual practices, strange drug use and ‘funny’
ideas.

In the 1960s, LSD was not sufficient even coupled with rock & roll. It only
brought oppression. It was like a failed alchemy. Instead of the dissolving and
recrystalizing at a higher and more angelic level, thousands of prisons were
built and the entire thing failed. But this spirit is the spirit, the spirit of
life itself, the spirit of novelty itself, and it will not be suppressed for
long in any time or place. So now again it comes.

After thirty years and after many changes, it’s among us again. I assume,
looking at all of you, that to some degree you represent this or act it out,
because it’s a spirit of dissent that says we will not serve the values of
materialism. We will not serve the values of the ego and the values that
separate and breakdown the community.

So here it is again. What is different this time that we might have some greater
hope of actually coming through to the beginning of the third millennium without
having to hang our heads when we tell the story to our grandchildren? I will
submit to you this evening that the difference between then – 1965 through 1970
– and now to the turn of the century, is the following. We have that experience
under our belt. We shall not be so stupid again. The I Ching says, “Never
confront evil directly and never name it directly because it finds weapons to
defend itself.”

We are not an army; this is what Frederick didn’t understand. He was a king, but
he was not an army when it came to the White Mountain. We are not an army, so
our strategy must be stealth. It’s an alchemical strategy. What do I mean by
stealth? I mean the house of constipated reason must be infiltrated by art, by
dreamers, and by vision. What is new? There are massive technologies available
to us, not available in the 1960s. They were not designed for us, they were not
intended for us, and it was never ever thought that such power should flow into
the hands of freaks such as ourselves. Nevertheless, through the perverse nature
of the unfolding of the world, we have such tools. I’m referring, as you
probably anticipate to the World Wide Web and the Internet.
No gay kind in Montana, no Chinese scholar in Botswana, and no person anywhere
with a specialized interest or predilection now need feel alone. There is no
aloneness. You can find your people. One of the things Tim Leary said in the
1960s that I always remembered but I never heard anybody talk about or ever
really heard him quote. It was a great rallying cry. It was much better than
Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out; and it was this: “find the others.” “Find the
others, and then you will know what to do.” Well now you can find the others.
You don’t have to stick a flower in your hair and go to San Francisco. You just
go to the web.

Find the others! We all need to create affinity groups which are subsets of the
much larger community that we’re part of. Then using this technology, which was
designed to keep track of us, to pick our pockets and to sell us junk we don’t
want, use this technology to produce art. We must produce massive amounts of
subversive art, and all art is subversive. I’m not calling for an ideological
agenda. All truth which springs from the individual is subversive, because, and
this is a theme of mine that I’m getting more and more into the longer I live –
Culture is not your friend. This is an odd message for the late 1990s because
we’re all being told, you knew you were Jewish but your forgot you Sicilian
grandmother – you have to honor all of your family. Romanian bring it forward,
the dances of this that and the other. I hate all of this stuff. I’m Irish. It’s
a weird thing to be. It’s a haunted, twisted people, as a people. All peoples,
meaning tribes, have horrible stories to tell about who they did under and who
they screwed over. When you’re asked to identify with your culture, you’re asked
to take this on. I reject it.
```

```
These psychedelics, which in the sixties and fifties, were simply called
consciousness expanding drugs, a good ole phenomenological description.  If
there’s an iota of possibility that they expand consciousness, then we must put
our attention on this area because it is the absence of consciousness that is
making our situation so very uncomfortable.  People going for the fast buck,
people elbowing their neighbor and their neighbor’s concerns out of the way,
trampling over each other.  Low consciousness activity is the problem.

#OPENING 42:15

Often I have the feeling that it’s no longer at least in my own life about
seeking the answer, its about facing it.

It isn’t about “Is it yoga? Is it Taoism? Is it this is it that?” I think now I
know, at least for me what it is, but that the answer is so appalling and
requires such courage to execute it and carry it through that I don’t know what
to do.

I have no doubt that we could all become the Taoist hermit on cold mountain, and
be that person of whom people in the valley say “Oh him! We see him sometimes
when it snows very deeply, because he comes further down for wood” He comes and
goes in the mist and never talks to anybody, we could all become that person.

There are no barriers to ultimate spiritual attainment, but what about your
mortgage? And your lover? And your devotion to French chocolate? And all of
these things.

That’s tricky. That’s very, very tricky.

For instance like the matter of the flying saucer, I have no doubt that if you
took 10 people selected from this group and trekked days east of Death Valley
and stayed up all night and everybody took 8 dried grams of mushrooms and hoped
and hollered and waited that something would happen that would be so appalling
and so destructive to our preconceptions of what’s possible in this universe
that you just come out of it pointing into the desert saying “mmMMM mmMMM
MMMMM!!!”

I’m careful, I don’t doubt that appalling, appalling, appalling things can
happen and reality can be completely pulled to pieces, I don’t know what that
means but I really want to deal with that on my terms. That’s a kind of fear you
know, it’s a kind of holding back. That’s why, I know people who seem to me
superhumanly reckless, I mean they tell me the thing they do and I just shake my
head, you know because of the power, of the vistas of the energies that they
must have laid their hands on. It’s too much for me, I am a simple scholar and
bookish collector type. I am like Brother John here.

We like our home and hearth. But that’s the challenge you see, that’s the weird
things of psychedelics. It’s a path, but in a sense it’s the end of the path,
and then what do you do? Now it’s up to you, it’s no more about the guru says
“In 5 years you’ll make progress, or if you just keep eating this spiralina, or
fiddling with your crystals” or something, but no, you’ve arrived, now what do
you do with it?

Do you really want to be a wandering figure at the edge of civilization glimpses
occasionally with your tattered clothes and your wild ravings…

Kat: Nick and I were talking this morning about envisioning something and how
these plants help you to generate a vision of something real that you want to
create or organize in the world and then they help you to have the discipline
and dedication to carry it out.

In the real day-to-day telephone call, how do I get the money for it? Kind of
way.

That I think is a real strength for it that all of us have, it’s one of the
responsibilities of being granted the visions is to make the visions then as
real as you can.

We do have our bodies here on earth for some time to come, we do have pleasure
of course which we should all indulge in, but we also have responsibility to
make it as much as like, even if it’s a small step, as much like as that
fantastic thing we can see in our visions and I think that it gives you the
object then it helps you move towards it, and we need to do that work and keep
refreshing our vision if it starts to get weak or we start to give up on it. If
we need to shift directions slightly.
