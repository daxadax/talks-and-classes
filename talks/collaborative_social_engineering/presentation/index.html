            ...if we start talking about redesigning human nature, people say, "This is
            what Hitler was talking about!"  - as soon as you start redefining human
            nature, you redefine it worse, the beast returns. It means we have no
            faith whatsoever and we believe the given situation is the best of all
            possible worlds...and i don't belive that.

          <p>
            I agree there have been horrendous misapplications of the wish to
            redesign human nature, but on the other hand, the style which lets it
            just develop like an untended weedy lot has produced a fairly
            weedy lot of leaders with no great apparent commitment to the
            salvation of the human race.

            We're like fish trying to discover water - these are fairly subtle issues but
            the payoff is being able to design our way toward a more humane culture.

            It's very important to build an inclusive community and a community
            that has a sense of direction and I think the internet empowers this
            far more than any other tool that has been handed to us, except
            psychedelics. If you take psychedelics and the internet and music
            and put all of that together, you have the basis for a new community
            that is wider than you know.

            We think in a vague way about what we want, but if we do not
            formulate what we want, nothing will happen.  You can never get
            anything until you can say, 'I want this'. Then perhaps you may get
            it or perhaps you may not; but you can never get it unless you know
            what it is.

            What psychedelics do is they give a direction to [social] chaos,
            a dimension of vertical ascent - because inevitably out of the psychedelic
            situation emerges not despair, not self-indulgence but wild-eyed idealism.
            That's the inevitable product of any psychedelically-driven social process.

            We were talking about envisioning something and how these plants
            help you to generate a vision of something real that you want to
            create or organize in the world and then they help you to have the
            discipline and the dedication to carry them out in the real day to
            day, telephone calls and 'how do i get the money for it' kind of way
            and that one of the responsibilties of being granted the visions is
            to make the visions then as real as you can.

            The importance of virtual reality, as I see it, is it is a
            technology that will allow us to show each other our dreams. We will
            be able to build structures in the imagination that we cannot now
            share with each other. I imagine a world where children begin to build
            their virtual realities by the time they are 5, 6, 7.

            By the time they are 20, these virtual realities may be, practically
            speaking, the size of Manhattan. Well, then what real intimacy will mean is
            saying to someone, “would you like to visit my world? My world with my
            visions, my values, my dreams, my fears…” In a sense, what virtual reality
            is is a strategy to let us turn ourselves inside out so that we see each
            others’ minds.

            The French cartoonist Moebius asks the question in one of his books,
            ‘Is man good?’
          </p>
          <p>
            ...we’re actually going to get the chance to answer this
            question because all barriers to the expression of our will, our
            vision, our dream are falling away. Are we some kind of anti-life,
            sado-masochistic, suicidal contradiction, or can we break through
            the million years of primate programming and alpha-male hierarchical
            dominace to actually uncover the angelic force that we glimpse
            within ourselves - if there is a demon in human nature, there is
            surely an angel of equal power - so it's just about breaking this free.
