# It's very important to build an inclusiveÂ·community and a community that has a
# sense of direction and i think the internet empowers this far more than any
# other tool that has been handed to us, except psychedelics.
# if you take psychedelics and the internet and music and put all of that together,
# you have the basis for a new community that is wider than you know.

# What psychedelics do is they give a direction to [social] chaos,
# a dimension of vertical ascent - because inevitably out of the psychedelic
# situation emerges not dispair, not self-indulgence but wild-eyed idealism.
# That's the inevitable product of any psychedelically-driven social process.
# How well that idealistic idea then brokers its way to the throne if it does
# is another issue.

# Aim means direction, a certain line. If my aim is to go home from here,
# it will be right for me to turn to the right and wrong to turn to the left.
# This is how the principle of good and evil can be established. There can
# be no definition of good and evil, or right and wrong, without first
# establishing an aim or direction. When you have an aim, then what is
# opposed to your aim or takes you away from it is wrong, and what helps
# your aim is right.

# I don't know how to envision the future...there is going to be some fusion of

# existance or is it some kind of tao-lie, zen-like acceptance of place and

# All problems have become problems of human psychology - everything can be
# done, it's all about how to convince people in a demomcracy to pay for it, all
# problems have acheived a human dimension:
# - the state of the atmosphere: human problem;
# - the temperature of the oceans: human problem;
# everything has to do with changing and reengineering the human mind. Now the
# real barrier to doing this as i see it is the cultural momentum of the past
# which is a very nice and sanitized way of saying fundamentalist religion -
# fundamentalist religion goes into a tizzy when you start to - they would say
# - tamper with human nature.

# If we're all god's children, how come we've rigged the earth with dynamite
# and we're flipping coins to see who gets to set it off.
#
# We've been infected with the idea of original sin, and this is part of what
# keeps us infantile. We actually believe, i think, every single one of us, at
# some level, that we are flawed, unfit, and this is paralyzing because if we
# start talking about redesigning human nature, people say, "oh, wow, this is what hitler
# was talking about!" as soon as you start redefining human nature, you
# redefine it worse, the beast returns. It means we have no faith whatsoever
# and we believe the given situation is the best of all possible worlds, is
# what that's saying and i don't belive that.
#
# I agree there have been horrendous misapplications of the wish to redesign
# human nature, but on the other hand, the style which just lets it develop like
# an untended weedy lot has produced a fairly weedy lot of leaders with no great
# apparent commitment to the salvation of the human race.
