Introduction: this is presented as an exercise to the reader

I. Society and the Concept of Social Engineering
  A. What is 'social engineering'? - a metaphor to machinery
    1. J.C. Van Marken introduced this term in 1894
    2. Social engineering has a bad name from how it has been used - great leap forward, propeganda
    3. [QUOTE] If we start talking about redesigning human nature...
  B. It's been done badly, but the concept has merit...
    1. So how to do it better? it's difficult...
    2. [QUOTE] We're like fish trying to discover water
    3. Dynamic balance between individuals, communities and institutions [CARL/DCL]
      a. currently out of balance - how to balance it? (just some ideas, not comprehensive)
      b. individual level - better education (T.H. White "Education is experience")
      c. individual level - ritual and initiation (that's another talk...)
      d. [QUOTE] It's very important to build an inclusive community
      e. community level - inclusivity and a sense of direction
      f. institutional level - strongly fear-based (privacy, for example...)
II. How to (maybe) engineer better
  A. AIM is pivotal
    1. [QUOTE] We think in a vague way of what we want...
    2. What *DO* we want? (an exercise for the reader)
     -- empowered individuals and communities and a relationship of trust with insitutions
    3. My proposed workflow
      Brainstorm > Improv and Psychedelics
      Prototype > VR
      Implementation > IRL
  B. Psychedelics
    1. [QUOTE] What psychedelics do is they give a direction to [social] chaos...
    2. "The essence of experience is self-reliance" - trust in yourself and the world around you
    3. They reveal impossible realities
    4. [QUOTE] We were talking about envisioning something...
  C. Improv
    1. Improv demands and cultivates relationships of trust
    2. Improv is a sketch new realities - it generates ideas quickly
    3. [QUOTE] We select a possibility...
  D. Virtual Reality
    1. VR can create (or re-create) worlds without physical constraints
    2. It too is a tool to sketch reality, but on a deeper level
    3. It manifests ideas such that you can walk around inside of them
    4. [QUOTE] The importance of Virtual Reality...
III. Conclusion
  A. Psychedelics, Improv and Virtual Reality could be powerful tools to build a better world
  B. [QUOTE] Is man good..?
  C. Special Thanks
  D. Resources
