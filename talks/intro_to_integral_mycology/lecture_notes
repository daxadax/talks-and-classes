"Mushrooms help us reconect to nature in profound ways" - Stamets, "Mycelium
Running"

I. Intro: Integral Systems
  A. Linear vs Integral - all about energy
    1. Flow
      a. straight lines in a linear system
      b. spiderweb/spirals in an integral system
    2. Function
      a. unique in a linear system
      b. diverse/overlapping in an integral system
    3. Efficiency
      a. unimportant so usually low - not prioritized 
      b. crucial so usually very high - high priority
    4. Channels
      a. singular in a linear system
      b. multiple in an integral system
    5. Overflow
      a. often not even handled in a linear system
      b. prioritized as part of the system in an integral system
    6. Complexity
      a. simple but unstable
      b. entagled but stable
II. Intro: Mycology
  A. [IMAGE] Life Cycle of Mushrooms (Russel, pg 18)
  B. Varieties of Mushrooms
    1. Primary Decomposers - can be cultivated easily
      a. Shiitake (Lentinula edodes)
      b. Oyster (Pleurotus spp)
      c. Reishi (Ganoderma lucidium) 
    2. Secondary Decomposers - can be cultivated
      a. Button/Portobello (Agaricus bisporus)
      b. Shaggy Mane (Coprinus comatus)
      c. 'Magic Mushrooms' (Psilocybe cubensis)
    3. Mycorrhizal - difficult/impossible to cultivate
      a. Chanterelles (Cantharellus spp)
      b. Truffles (Tuber spp)
      c. Fly Agaric (Amanita Muscaria)
  C. Foraging vs Cultivation
    1. Different paths
    2. Analogous to Botany vs. Horticulture
III. Integral Mycology
  A. Multiple functions at each stage of life
    1. Spores
      a. chain oil (Mycelium Running)
      b. Insulation (Eben Bayer)
    2. Mycelium
      a. Mycorestoration
        i. -remediation
        ii. -foam
          - insulation
          - material, such as leather
          - art
        iii. -forestry
      b. companion planting
      c. medicine
      d. fruit
    3. Spent substrate
      a. new substrate
        i. primary -> secondary decomposers
      b. fertilizer
      c. biocoal/fuel
      d. feed for animals
  B. Direct recycling at the consumer/community level
    1. [IMAGE] Paper/Organic waste is 63% of global solid waste
IV. Q & A

V. Workshop
  A. Introduce equipment
    1. Large jar (750ml+) + filter lid
    2. Pasteurized hydrated waste paper (water ratio 1.34)
    3. Grain spawn
  B. [ACTIVITY] Fill lid with polyfill
  C. Orientation -> where are we in the lifecycle?
  D. Build sample jar + address questions
  E. [ACTIVITY] Participants build jar
  F. Questions & Wrap-up
