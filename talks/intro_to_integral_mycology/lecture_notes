II. Intro: Integral Systems
  A. By defintion
  B. Contrasting properties of Linear vs. Integral systems
    1. Flow
      a. straight lines in a linear system
      b. spiderweb/spirals in an integral system
    2. Function
      a. unique in a linear system
      b. diverse/overlapping in an integral system
    3. Efficiency
      a. unimportant so usually low - not prioritized
      b. crucial so usually very high - high priority
    4. Channels
      a. singular in a linear system
      b. multiple in an integral system
    5. Overflow
      a. often not even handled in a linear system
      b. prioritized as part of the system in an integral system
    6. Complexity
      a. simple but unstable
      b. entagled but stable
III. Intro: Mycology
  A. [IMAGE] Life Cycle of Mushrooms (Russel, pg 18)
  B. Varieties of Mushrooms
    1. Ecological Roles of Decomposers
      a. new elements cannot be created, they must recycled
      b. fungi break down lignin and cellulose
      c. fungi are the only thing that break break down lignin and cellulose
      d. the digestive enzymes of mycelium make soluable forms of nutrients that
      would otherwise be inaccessible
      e. fungi are the alchemist of the natural world - they tease eternal life
      from dead matter
    2. Example Decomposers
      a. Shiitake (Lentinula edodes)
      b. Oyster (Pleurotus spp)
      c. Reishi (Ganoderma lucidium)
      d. Button/Portobello (Agaricus bisporus)
      e. 'Magic Mushrooms' (Psilocybe cubensis)
    3. Ecological Roles of Mycorrhizal Fungi
      a. Expands the absorptive area of the plants roots 10-1000x
        i. Growth rate ++
        ii. Survival time of roots ++
        iii. Nutritional content ++
        iv. Medicinal quality ++
        v. Flowering rate ++
        vi. Time to reach maturity --
      b. Fungi produce digestive enzymes which unlock nutrients
    4. Example Mycorrhizal Fungi
      a. Chanterelles (Cantharellus spp)
      b. Truffles (Tuber spp)
      c. Fly Agaric (Amanita Muscaria)
IV. Integral Mycology
  "Mushrooms help us reconect to nature in profound ways" - Stamets, "Mycelium Running"
  A. Multiple functions at each stage of life
    1. Spores
      a. chain oil (Mycelium Running)
      b. Insulation (Eben Bayer)
    2. Mycelium
      a. Mycorestoration
        i. remediation
          - oil
          - munitions
          - nerve gas
        iii. forestry
      b. companion planting
      c. medicine
        i. many types of highly medicinal mushrooms
        ii. adaptogens
        iii. 'custom myco-medicine'
      e. materials
        i. insulation
        ii. material, such as leather
        iii. artistic medium
        iv. packaging
      d. fruit
    3. Spent substrate
      a. 'species sequencing'
      b. fertilizer
      c. biocoal/fuel
      d. feed for animals
  B. Direct recycling at the consumer/community level
    1. [IMAGE] Paper/Organic waste is 63% of global solid waste
V. Growing Mushrooms on Paper Waste
V. Q & A
VI. Workshop
  A. Introduce equipment
    1. Large jar (750ml+) + filter lid
    2. Pasteurized hydrated waste paper (water ratio 1.34)
    3. Grain spawn
  B. [ACTIVITY] Fill lid with polyfill
  C. Orientation -> where are we in the lifecycle?
  D. Build sample jar + address questions
  E. [ACTIVITY] Participants build jar
  F. Questions & Wrap-up

  as many points can be made cotangentially to each other defines the complexity
