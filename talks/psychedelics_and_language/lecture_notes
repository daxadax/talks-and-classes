# It is easy to see that the label "Jew" was a Damnation in 
# Nazi Germany, but actually the label "Jew" is a Damnation anywhere, 
# even where anti-Semitism does not exist. "He is a Jew," "He is a 
# doctor," and "He is a poet" mean, to the card indexing centre of the 
# cortex, that my experience with him will be like my experience with 
# other Jews, other doctors, and other poets.

# The social environment is what has given a person words and what 
# has joined words with specific meanings and value judgments; 
# the same environment continues ceaselessly to determine and 
# control a person's verbal reactions throughout his entire life.

# and if language is an organ of perception, how does this effect how
# you 'see' the world?

# It is now theoretically possible to link the human nervous system 
# into a radio network so that, micro-miniaturized receivers being 
# implanted in people's brains, the messages coming out of these 
# radios would be indistinguishable to the subjects from the voice 
# of their own thoughts. One central transmitter, located in the 
# nation's capital, could broadcast all day long what the authorities 
# wanted the people to believe. 
# It is ironic that people will find such a concept both shocking and 
# frightening. Like Orwell's 1984, this is not a fantasy of the future 
# but a parable of the present. Every citizen in every authoritarian 
# society already has such a "radio" built into his or her brain. 
# This radio is the little voice that asks, each time a desire is 
# formed, "Is it safe? Will my wife (my husband/my boss/my church/my 
# community) approve? Will people ridicule and mock me? Will the 
# police come and arrest me?"

# from childhood you've had people play games with you, since school 
# you've been told to let your actions be dictated by shame, and as you
# got older, you've probably developed a great number of roles, some of 
# them directly contradictory, and for this reason you have become, by 
# necessity, increasingly inauthentic. 
# Another way to see it is that you've made choices which have reduced 
# the possibility of living authentically to almost nothing. What has 
# happened is that you have been presented with an image of the world 
# that is inauthentic and over time you have learned to feel at home 
# in that environment

# they throw you into a situation that where there is no turning back 
# and there are no easy answers and there is no prior experience that 
# you can fall back on to ask for help because there is simply no way 
# to formulate it in language and that is to say, it's an impossible 
# reality.  it cannot happen and yet you are experiencing it! and you
# are powerless to do anything but stand aside as the language that 
# formed your entire reality to this point is rendered powerless and
# turned into a pile of ash at your feet.
