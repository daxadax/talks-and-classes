          <p class='quote'>
            It is easy to see that the label "Jew" was a Damnation in Nazi Germany, 
            but actually the label "Jew" is a Damnation anywhere, even where anti-Semitism 
            does not exist.

            "He is a Jew," "He is a doctor," and "He is a poet" mean, to the card indexing centre of the cortex, 
            that my experience with him will be like my experience with other Jews, other doctors, and other poets.

          <h2 class='book-title'>What Do You Say After You Say Hello?</h2>

          <p style='font-size:85% !important' class='fat-quote quote'>
            Initially [a child's] goal is to walk, then it is to walk to something.  Once
            he walks to people, he has to know what to do after he gets there.  At
            first they smile and hug him, and all he has to do is be, or at most,
            cuddle.  They expect nothing from him beyond getting there.            </p>
          <p style='font-size:85% !important' class='fat-quote quote'>
            Later they do expect something, so he learns to say Hello.  After a while,
            that is not enough either, and they expect more.  So he learns to
            offer them various stimuli in order to get their responses in return.
            Thus he is eternally grateful (believe it or not) to his parents for
            giving him a pattern: how to approach people in such a way as to get
            the desired responses.

          <p class='quote'>
            The social environment is what has given a person words and what has joined
            words with specific meanings and value judgments; the same environment
            continues ceaselessly to determine and control a person's verbal
            reactions throughout his entire life.

            It is now theoretically possible to link the human nervous system into a radio
            network so that, micro-miniaturized receivers being implanted in people's
            brains, the messages coming out of these radios would be indistinguishable to
            the subjects from the voice of their own thoughts. One central transmitter,
            located in the nation's capital, could broadcast all day long what the
            authorities wanted the people to believe.

            Like Orwell's 1984, this is not a fantasy of the future but a parable of the
            present. Every citizen in every authoritarian society already has such a "radio"
            built into his or her brain. This radio is the little voice that asks, each time
            a desire is formed, "Is it safe? Will my wife (my husband/my boss/my church/my
            community) approve? Will people ridicule and mock me? Will the police come and
            arrest me?"

          <h2 class='book-title'>Psychological Types</h2>
          <h3 class='book-author'>- C.G. Jung -</h3>
          <p class='quote'>
            The ego complex is a content of consciousness as well as a condition
            of consciousness, for a psychic element is conscious to me so far as
            it is related to the ego complex.  But so far as the ego is only the
            center of my field of consciousness, it is not identical with the
            whole of my psyche, being merely one complex among other complexes.

          <h3 class='book-author'>- C.G. Jung -</h3>
          <p class='quote'>
            ...the alchemist saw the essence of his art in separation and analysis on
            the one hand and synthesis and consolidation on the other. For him
            there was first of all an initial state in which opposite tendencies
            or forces were in conflict; secondly there was the great question of a
            procedure which would be capable of bringing the hostile elements and
            qualities, once they were separated, back to unity again. The initial
            state, named the chaos, was not given from the start but had to be
            sought for as the <i>prima materia</i>.

          <p class='quote'>
            If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save
            you. If you fail to bring forth what is within you, what you fail to 
            bring forth will destroy you.
